## ML techniques to answer ReCAPTCHA challenges

ReCAPTCHAWiz combines Selenium with a trained convolutional neural network to classify images that contain mountains or not in order to pass Google ReCAPTCHA challenges.  See example of Google's ReCAPTCHA [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo).
